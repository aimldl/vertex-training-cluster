# Vertex AI Traininc Cluster (VTC)


``` VTC was previously known as Vertex Model Development Service (VMDS). ```

## Overview

Vertex AI Training Cluster is a fully managed compute infrastructure designed to streamline distributed machine learning workloads on Google Cloud. It enables the provisioning of scalable, high-performance clusters optimized for training complex models, allowing MLOps teams to execute large-scale jobs with minimal operational overhead and maximized resource efficiency.

See the official blog to learn more about it.
