# Vertex AI Traininc Cluster (VTC)


``` VTC was previously known as Vertex Model Development Service (VMDS). ```

## Overview

Vertex AI Training Cluster is a fully managed compute infrastructure designed to streamline distributed machine learning workloads on Google Cloud. It enables the provisioning of scalable, high-performance clusters optimized for training complex models, allowing MLOps teams to execute large-scale jobs with minimal operational overhead and maximized resource efficiency.


Slurm (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is an open-source workload manager and job scheduling system to manage Linux clusters, particularly in HPC (High-Performance Computing) environments.

> "Slurm is an industry standard known for optimized GPU scheduling, automated fault tolerance, and simplified parallel job launch."
